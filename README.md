In my presentation I discuss Pascal's identity and Pascal's triangle. Pascal’s identity is the basis for a geometric arrangement of the binomial coefficients in Pascal’s triangle. Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array constructed by summing adjacent elements in preceding rows. Pascals triangle can be used for various purposes such as in the binomial expansion of a polynomial, in probability, to find the number of combinations, and can be used to find the Fibonacci series.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99448275/205558742-e84078f6-53f1-46c2-90a4-895a56075b87.png)
